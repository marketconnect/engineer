 * @brief The ProjectPropertiesHandler class
 * A central class that handles, keeps and provides all utilities
 * to easily manage all kind of properties used in a project.
 *
 * This is a new class since QElectroTech 0.9
 * by consequence it is small and you can find a lot of properties (made before qet 0.9)
 * everywhere in the code.
 * All new properties should be managed by this class
 * (of course if it makes sense to be managed by this class).
 * Older properties which are not managed by this class but should be,
 * will be managed in future.
